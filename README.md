# Attendance System

NOTE : README GENERATED BY CHATGPT

## Overview
This project is an attendance management system designed to track and view student attendance. The system is built using React for the frontend and Firebase for backend services.

## Firebase Structure
The Firebase Firestore database is structured as follows:

### Collections
#### Students
- **Document ID**: `enrollment_no` (string)
- **Fields**:
  - `name`: (string) Name of the student.
  - `group`: (string) Group to which the student belongs.

#### Attendance
- **Document ID**: `year` (string) – The year in which the attendance is recorded.
- **Subcollections**:
  - **month** (e.g., january, february, etc.)
    - **Document ID**: `date` (string) – The date of the attendance record.
    - **Fields**:
      - `enrollment_no`: (string) The enrollment number of the student.
      - `name`: (string) Name of the student.
      - `status`: (string) Attendance status (present or absent).

## Data Flow
### Fetching Attendance Data
- The `ViewHistory` component fetches attendance data from the Firestore based on the selected month.
- It queries the attendance collection for the current year and selected month.
- The data is then processed to construct a table with student enrollment numbers, names, and their attendance records for each date.

### Student Data
- The `UploadStudents` component allows uploading student data from a CSV file.
- The CSV file should contain the following columns: `enrollment_no`, `name`, and `group`.
- This data is stored in the Students collection in Firestore.

### Filtering
- The `ViewHistory` component includes a dropdown to filter attendance by month and group.
- By default, it shows attendance for all students.
- When a group is selected, only students from that group are displayed in the table.

## Components
### UploadStudents
- Allows uploading student data via CSV.
- Parses the CSV file and saves each student's data to the Students collection in Firestore.

### ViewHistory
- Displays attendance records in a table format.
- Requires password authentication to view the data.
- Includes month and group filtering options.

## Setup
### Firebase Configuration
- Ensure Firebase is properly configured in your project.
- The Firebase configuration should be set in the `firebase.js` file.

### Running the Project
1. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Start the development server using `npm start`.

### Uploading Data
1. Prepare a CSV file with student data.
2. Use the `UploadStudents` component to upload the data to Firebase.

## Notes
- Make sure your Firebase security rules are configured properly to protect the data.
- Ensure that the fields in your CSV file match the expected format.
